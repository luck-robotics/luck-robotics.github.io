Hi! I am a PhD student in Evolutionary Robotics within the computational intelligence (CI) research group at the VU, fascinated by the interplay between biology and engineering. Specifically I explore Human-and-AI (HAI) co-design approaches to aerial robotics, where AI methods evolve drone morphology, control, and planning together, going beyond traditional, human-engineered designs. By embedding human constraints and leveraging techniques like evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning, we aim to generate unconventional, high-performance drones that outperform current designs.

I love bouldering, video games, and EDM. Iâ€™m always happy to chat about research, so feel free to come say hi and connect!
